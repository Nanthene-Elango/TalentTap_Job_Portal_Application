            <p>The Platform reserves the right to remove any job listing that violates these Terms and Conditions, at the sole discretion of the Platform’s administrators.

            <h4>2.2.1. Grounds for Removal</h4>
            <p>Job listings may be removed for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Violation of Legal Requirements</strong>: Promoting illegal activities, such as unlawful employment practices, fraudulent schemes, or non-compliance with labor laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Discriminatory or Offensive Content</strong>: Including language or requirements based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, age) or offensive content (e.g., profanity, hate speech).</li>
                <li><strong>Misleading or False Information</strong>: Providing inaccurate job details, such as false titles, unrealistic salaries, or undisclosed conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Spam or Irrelevant Content</strong>: Posting advertisements, vague listings, or duplicate jobs without justification.</li>
                <li><strong>Violation of Platform Policies</strong>: Posting in unauthorized categories, collecting personal information without consent, or bypassing verification requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Security or Technical Issues</strong>: Containing malicious links, malware, or content that disrupts Platform functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Employer Account Issues</strong>: Associated with a suspended or terminated account due to non-payment, legal complaints, or other violations.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative Discretion</strong>: Deemed detrimental to the Platform’s reputation or user experience, such as listings generating significant complaints.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2.2.2. Removal Process</h4>
            <p>Job listings may be flagged for removal via automated systems, user reports, or admin review. Admins may use the Platform’s dashboard to permanently delete non-compliant listings. Employers will be notified of removals via email or Platform messaging, including the reason (e.g., "Removed due to discriminatory content"), except in cases of severe violations (e.g., malicious content).</p>
            
            <h4>2.2.3. Appeals</h4>
            <p>Employers may appeal a removal within 7 days by contacting <a href="mailto:support@jobportal.com" class="text-violet">support@jobportal.com</a>, providing evidence of compliance. The Platform’s decision on appeals is final.</p>
            
            <h3>2.3. Consequences of Violations</h3>
            <p>Violations may result in:</p>
